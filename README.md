Chapter 1 Introduction


              The modern urban landscape is marked by fast population expansion, increased motor traffic, and a commensurate increase in demand for parking spaces. As cities grow and densify, good parking resource management becomes increasingly important in order to reduce traffic congestion, increase urban mobility, and improve the overall quality of life for both inhabitants and tourists. In response to these issues, the creation of intelligent parking management systems has developed as an important field of study and innovation.
      
                 This project is dedicated to the development of a cutting-edge parking place monitoring system using cutting-edge computer vision technologies. The system's main purpose is to revolutionise how parking spots are monitored, analysed, and managed in urban contexts. The system's goal is to give parking managers, city planners, and motorists with actionable insights regarding parking spot availability and occupancy status through the use of artificial intelligence, image processing, and real-time data analytics. The use of computer vision techniques to enable precise parking spot recognition and tracking in real time is at the core of this research. Conventional parking management techniques, such static signs and manual monitoring, are frequently inaccurate, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. On the other hand, a computer vision-based strategy might provide automatic, dependable, and efficient parking space monitoring, opening the door for more intelligent and adaptable parking management systems.
             The primary objective of the system is to address the pressing need for efficient parking resource distribution and congestion management. By providing real-time information on parking space availability, the system empowers motorists to make informed decisions about where to park, thereby reducing the time spent searching for parking and minimizing traffic congestion in urban areas. Additionally, parking administrators can use the data generated by the system to optimize parking space allocation, implement dynamic pricing strategies, and improve overall parking efficiency.
            Advanced image processing algorithms, occupancy detection methods, and data visualisation tools are some of the system's essential parts. Parking spot recognition accuracy is increased, noise is decreased, and picture quality is improved by the use of image preprocessing techniques. Parking space occupancy statistics are presented in a user-friendly fashion via data visualisation tools, making it simple for stakeholders to understand and take action on the information. Occupancy detection algorithms examine video feeds or camera footage to identify unoccupied and occupied parking spots. The deployment of this technology has the potential to significantly alter parking management procedures in metropolitan settings. In addition to facilitating more effective use of parking resources and reducing traffic congestion, the system can improve the entire parking experience for motorists by offering real-time information regarding parking spot availability and occupancy status. Furthermore, the system's versatility and scalability make it ideal for implementation in a range of contexts, such as smart cities, transit hubs, business parking lots, and residential complexes.

            The invention of a computer vision-based parking spot monitoring system is a significant advancement in parking management technology. By employing cutting-edge technology and innovative techniques, the system offers a groundbreaking solution to the challenges related to parking spot management and monitoring in metropolitan environments. With continued research, development, and implementation, the concept of more intelligent, sustainable, and livable cities can become a reality.

            Furthermore, since urban environments are always changing, incorporating these cutting-edge systems can open the door to new innovations that will improve urban living. For example, future versions of this system may be able to anticipate patterns in parking demand, provide individualised parking solutions, and seamlessly integrate with other smart city infrastructures to create a comprehensive ecosystem for urban management. As a result, this project not only solves parking issues now but also lays the groundwork for future developments in urban mobility and smart city development.

            The capacity of this system to grow and adjust to different urban situations is a crucial component of its promise. For example, the system can handle massive amounts of parking data in real time in heavily populated urban regions, giving city planners crucial information and easing traffic. The system may be customised to satisfy unique local demands in smaller cities or residential complexes, guaranteeing maximum utilisation of limited parking spots and improving community satisfaction.

            Also, the system's real-time data analytics capabilities may be extremely important in shaping future urban planning guidelines. City officials can make educated decisions about infrastructure investments by looking into parking utilisation trends and patterns. This entails choosing the best sites for brand-new parking structures or renovating current ones to better meet demand. By ensuring that resources are used responsibly and efficiently, this data-driven approach creates a more organised and approachable urban environment.

            Supporting eco-friendly projects is one of this technology's other main advantages. Through reducing the amount of time cars spend looking for parking, the system can aid in lowering total vehicle emissions, which will improve the quality of the air and the urban ecosystem. In addition, the use of dynamic pricing schemes grounded in real-time occupancy data might encourage the adoption of substitute modes of transport during rush hours, thereby alleviating traffic congestion and advancing more environmentally friendly urban mobility solutions.


            We will need to work together with stakeholders including the public, urban planners, and city officials as we continue to develop and improve this technology. By interacting with these groups, we can make sure that the system takes into account the various demands of the community and resolves any privacy and data security issues. Fostering an open and transparent development process will help us gain credibility and support for the wider adoption of this cutting-edge parking management system.

            In conclusion, the development of a parking spot monitoring system based on computer vision represents a substantial step forward in the direction of more intelligent and effective urban living. This system, which makes use of cutting-edge technologies, offers a viable answer to the major problems associated with parking management in growing cities. In order to fully use this technology and achieve the goal of creating more sustainable, habitable, and well-managed urban settings, further innovation and cooperation will be crucial.



1.1	BACKGROUND

            The world's cities are becoming more and more urbanised, which has made it difficult to manage parking supplies effectively. The increasing density of metropolitan areas has led to a surge in the need for efficient parking options. Ineffective parking management leads to a protracted search for suitable parking places, which aggravates drivers and increases emissions and traffic congestion. In a dynamic metropolitan context, traditional solutions like human monitoring, static signs, and antiquated metering technologies have not been able to meet these requirements.

            New solutions to handling the challenges of urban parking are provided by recent technological breakthroughs. Intelligent parking management systems that provide real-time monitoring and analysis of parking spaces may now be developed with the use of computer vision and machine learning, two increasingly potent techniques. By automating the identification and monitoring of parked cars, giving precise, current information on parking availability, and lowering the need on human operators, these technologies enable the more effective use of parking resources. As an aspect of artificial intelligence, computer vision deals with the extraction, interpretation, and analysis of meaningful data from pictures or video clips. Applications for this technology may be found in a number of fields, including as medical imaging, security monitoring, and autonomous driving. Computer vision methods are used in parking management to analyse video feeds from cameras in parking areas in order to detect cars and ascertain whether parking spots are occupied

            Real-time analysis of camera footage is made feasible by merging computer vision with image processing techniques, which allows the system to distinguish between occupied and unoccupied parking spaces with accuracy. Image preprocessing methods that increase detection accuracy and improve image quality include thresholding, edge detection, and noise reduction. Based on the presence of a car, occupancy detection algorithms categorise parking spaces as either occupied or unoccupied. Through online portals, digital signs, or mobile applications, people may see and understand this information.

             The use of intelligent parking management systems offers benefits for both municipal managers and individual drivers. Plans for traffic management, dynamic pricing, and parking rules may all be improved with real-time data on parking availability. Parking managers have the ability to better distribute resources, modify price in response to demand, and promote turnover in areas with high traffic. These systems' data collection provide insightful information on parking trends and patterns, which influences future decisions about urban planning and infrastructure development.

             The objective's motivation is the hitting demand for creative answers to urban parking problems. The project's goal is to create an intelligent parking space monitoring system that offers real-time information on parking availability and occupancy by utilising computer vision and image processing techniques. This technology has the power to transform parking management procedures, improve urban mobility, and encourage the creation of more intelligent, environmentally friendly cities.


1.2	OBJECTIVE
            The purpose of this thesis is to use cutting-edge computer vision methods to construct a parking place monitoring system. The goal of this system is to greatly improve parking resource allocation and congestion management by offering precise and efficient real-time monitoring of parking space availability in authorised zones. Even for those with no prior coding skills, the system should be simple to use and easy to deploy. An outline of the suggested application may be seen below.


This system for monitoring parking spots ought to be capable of:

1.  Use powerful image processing techniques to load and pre-process video feeds or camera         footage in order to identify and keep an eye on parking places.

 3.   Provide more functions for improved resource allocation and decision-making, such as the ability to generate occupancy statistics and clearly visualise data.


            As stated before, the main goal of this project is to create a parking place monitoring system that is dependable and effective. In order to do this, we must first comprehend the state-of-the-art in computer vision methodology and the reasons for the ineffectiveness of particular approaches non the context of our particular application. To do this, we will compare many image processing algorithms and carry out in-depth tests and analysis to determine which method is best for our system. This entails assessing and outlining the benefits and drawbacks of various computer vision approaches, including adaptive thresholding, morphological operations, and others, in relation to real-time parking space monitoring.

CHAPTER 2 PARKING SPACE MONITORING SYSTEM



2.1   PARKING SPACE MONITORING SYSTEM OVERVIEW      

            Parking management system development has seen a significant shift from antiquated manual techniques to cutting-edge computer alternatives. In the past, parking management mostly depended on attendants checking spaces manually, which led to errors and inefficiencies. However, there has been a paradigm change towards more automated and efficient methods with the advent of contemporary parking spot monitoring devices.
 

Parking Management System Evolution

            In the past, parking attendants manually counted and documented the occupancy of parking spaces as part of traditional parking management systems. This method was prone to mistakes and delays, which resulted in inefficient use of resources and disgruntled users. On the other hand, contemporary parking management systems make use of cutting-edge technology like data analytics, IoT sensors, and computer vision to offer real-time parking spot management and monitoring.

Computer Vision Techniques
            The automatic identification and analysis of parking space occupancy made possible by computer vision methods is an important part of contemporary parking space monitoring systems. Using deep learning algorithms, these methods examine the visual data that parking lot cameras record. Computer vision technologies offer important insights into parking spot availability and utilisation by precisely recognising and tracking cars in real-time. Computer vision-based parking spot monitoring systems provide various advantages over previous approaches, including boosted accuracy, real-time monitoring, and scalability. Large parking lots may be handled by these systems with ease, and they can give parking managers useful information to maximise resource usage and enhance customer satisfaction.


Prospects and Difficulties

            Even though parking spot monitoring systems nowadays have gone a long way, there are always obstacles to be solved and room for more innovation. The optimisation of occupancy detection algorithms' precision and dependability, the strengthening of their interaction with other smart city technologies, and the resolution of privacy and security issues related to data gathering and processing are some of these.

            We are going to explore the elements and operation of our parking spot monitoring system in more detail in the upcoming chapters. These sections will include occupancy detection methods, picture preprocessing algorithms, and experimental assessment. Watch this space for a thorough examination of our cutting-edge parking spot monitoring system and how it affects contemporary parking management techniques.


2.1.1 Evolution of Parking Management Systems 
           
            Parking management system development is a reflection of global urbanisation concerns and larger technical improvements. The transition from antiquated to contemporary parking management systems emphasises the ongoing quest of effectiveness, precision, and ease.

Traditional Systems for Parking Management

          Parking management was mostly a manual operation in the beginning. Attendants kept an eye on parking lots, physically verifying if places were available and directing cars as necessary. Human error, inefficiency in vast parking lots, and the inability to give real-time information were some of the method's drawbacks. It was both expensive and labor-intensive, needing a sizable crew to oversee parking facilities, particularly during peak hours.

           Another conventional strategy was the use of manual ticketing systems. As they enter a parking facility, drivers are issued a ticket, which they must pay for depending on how much time they spent there. Even while this system included some automation, it was still mostly dependent on human participation and prone to problems like misplaced tickets and disagreements over parking times.

Automated Parking Systems' Emergence

            The emergence of automatic parking systems was facilitated by technological advancements. Simple automation was included in these systems, such as barrier gates that were managed by payment terminals and ticket dispensers. These technologies decreased the requirement for parking attendants, but their accuracy in occupancy detection and real-time monitoring remained limited.
          

                            
                      Figure. 1. Steps for taking information from the camera to system


2.1.2 Modern Parking Space Monitoring Technologies
           

           Parking management has been completely transformed by the use of cutting-edge technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, computer vision has become a potent tool for parking spot monitoring. Computer vision algorithms can recognise and track cars by analysing video feeds from strategically positioned cameras. This allows them to provide real-time data on parking spot occupancy.

Obstacles and Prospects for the Future

             Modern parking management systems still have a number of issues despite their progress. There are several obstacles to overcome, including making sure that detection algorithms are accurate and dependable, keeping up with infrastructure maintenance, and handling privacy issues with regard to sensor and video data. Furthermore, careful planning and coordination are needed to integrate these systems with other smart city efforts and traffic management technologies. The development of parking management systems demonstrates a shift from highly automated, intelligent solutions to labor-intensive, manual operations. The future of parking management will be greatly influenced by increasing technological innovation as cities continue to expand and the need for effective parking solutions rises.

               Parking management systems appear to have a bright future despite these obstacles. Continuous technological progress presents chances to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of detection systems, especially in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, ongoing R&D initiatives concentrate on addressing privacy concerns while guaranteeing the smooth incorporation of parking systems into larger urban infrastructure networks.

                  As well, a framework for integrating parking management systems with other urban services like public transit and traffic flow optimisation is made available by the growth of smart city initiatives. Cities may improve overall mobility and raise the standard of living for both locals and visitors by utilising data-driven insights and real-time monitoring capabilities.

                 Plus, the advent of self-driving cars offers new prospects for parking management. By using dynamic drop-off and pick-up zones or autonomous parking facilities, self-driving cars have the potential to reduce the need for regular parking spaces. Although this revolution in transportation necessitates creative methods to parking management, it also opens doors to more effectively using urban space and reducing traffic.

                    In result, even with ongoing difficulties, parking management may see more integrated, efficient, and sustainable solutions in the future. Parking management systems have the potential to significantly influence how cities evolve in the future by embracing technological advancement, resolving privacy problems, and coordinating with more general urban development goals.

  2.1.2.1 Computer Vision Techniques


            Since computer vision techniques offer reliable, scalable, and effective solutions, they have completely changed parking spot management and monitoring. Computer vision systems offer a high degree of accuracy and operational flexibility by automatically detecting, classifying, and tracking vehicles in real-time via the use of sophisticated image processing and machine learning algorithms.

 
      Figure. 3. Computer vision Applications in intelligent transportation 



Obtaining and Preparing Images

             A computer vision-based parking monitoring system's initial step is to take pictures or video feeds of the parking lot. To cover the whole parking lot, high-resolution cameras have been positioned in key locations. These cameras' infrared capabilities and other improvements allow them to function in a variety of lighting circumstances, including dimly lit areas.

            The key element of computer vision-based parking spot monitoring is object detection. Cutting-edge algorithms recognise and classify things in the pictures, setting apart cars from the backdrop. 


2.2 SYSTEM COMPONENTS AND FUNCTIONALITY
             
            The parking space monitoring system is a complete solution made to efficiently manage and maximise parking space utilisation. In order to guarantee that the system runs smoothly and offers real-time monitoring and administration capabilities, this section lists the key parts and their corresponding features. Excellent quality cameras and sensors that are thoughtfully positioned across the parking space are the system's main components. These gadgets constantly take pictures or record videos of the parking lot, guaranteeing that every spot is covered.

              The core functionality of the system involves detecting vehicles within the captured images. Advanced object detection algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), You Only Look Once (YOLO), and Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) are utilized. These algorithms accurately identify and classify vehicles, distinguishing them from other objects and background elements.

              Parking Space Mapping: A digital plan of the parking area is developed in order to map identified automobiles to specified parking spots. This includes:

Manual Annotation: To train the algorithm during the initial setup, parking spots may need to be manually marked on a few example photos.

Automatic Parking Space Segmentation: Using patterns and pre-established rules, algorithms automatically identify and divide up parking spots.

Perspective Transformation: Accurate space mapping is ensured by matching camera images to the parking lot layout.

              In the final analysis, the parking space monitoring system's features and components come together to offer a reliable option for effective parking management. The system guarantees the best possible use of parking resources and improves the parking experience for users with its sophisticated picture processing, real-time data integration, and user-friendly interfaces.



2.2.1 Image Preprocessing Algorithms

              In order to improve the quality of the input photos and facilitate the system's ability to discover and analyse parking spots, image preprocessing is an essential step in the parking space monitoring system. A number of crucial methods are used in the preprocessing pipeline to enhance image quality and lower noise. First and foremost, picture resizing guarantees that every input image has the same size, which is necessary to preserve consistency and processing speed. Next come methods for reducing noise in images, such Gaussian blurring, which evens out the image and lessens the impact of random noise. Histogram equalisation is one example of a contrast enhancement technique that is used to increase the visibility of objects in a picture and make it simpler to differentiate between parked automobiles and vacant spaces.
 
                                   Figure. 3.1. Parking Space Detection System

               Another benefit is that by converting an RGB image to a single intensity channel without sacrificing important information, grayscale conversion is frequently used to minimise computing complexity. After that, edge detection algorithms—like Canny edge detection—are used to draw attention to the edges of items in the picture. Together, these actions set up the picture for later processing phases, guaranteeing that the system can recognise and categorise each parking space's occupancy state with accuracy. These preprocessing approaches let the system monitor parking spot availability more accurately and reliably, which eventually leads to more effective parking management.

             In besides saving computational complexity, grayscale conversion preserves important details from the RGB image. Then, to highlight item boundaries in the picture, edge detection algorithms such as Canny edge detection are used. These first actions lay the groundwork for later processing phases and guarantee that the system can correctly recognise and classify each parking space's occupancy status. By means of these preprocessing methods, the parking place availability is monitored by the system with increased accuracy and dependability, which in turn leads to more effective parking management procedures.

             Then there is the system's incorporation of real-time data analytics opens up possibilities for resource allocation and decision-making that is well-informed. Authorities can identify patterns and trends in parking usage data by analysing it over extended periods of time. This allows for strategic planning related to parking management and optimisation. By providing decision-makers with actionable insights, this data-driven strategy enables the execution of focused initiatives to successfully manage parking difficulties. The system's accuracy and performance can also be improved by continuous study and improvement of its algorithms and procedures, guaranteeing its continual efficacy in a variety of urban settings.



2.2.2 Occupancy Detection Techniques

             Our parking space monitoring system relies heavily on occupancy detection to identify whether spaces are occupied or available. Our approach combines many image processing methods to provide accurate occupancy measurements. The video stream is first preprocessed by turning it into grayscale and using Gaussian blur to reduce noise. Then, using adaptive thresholding, a binary picture with foreground components highlighted is produced. This picture is further refined using median blurring, which removes small artefacts. Following this, morphological techniques such as dilation are applied to magnify regions of interest, which facilitates the identification of continuous areas that correspond to cars.

            The key to our occupancy detection is found in the analysis of these photos after processing. A cropped zone is removed for every parking space, and the number of non-zero pixels inside is counted. Occupancy status is determined by a predetermined threshold: spaces below it are empty, while spaces above it are occupied. Our method overlays coloured rectangles representing spot statuses on the original video feed in order to provide real-time feedback. The panel shows available slot counts; green indicates availability, red indicates occupancy. The combination of these methods guarantees precise identification of vehicles, which is essential for effective management of parking resources and enhanced user experience.

            A key component of our parking space monitoring system is occupancy detection, which uses a variety of image processing methods to guarantee accurate observations. The video stream is first preprocessed, then it is converted to grayscale and Gaussian blurred to reduce noise. Adaptive thresholding is then used to create a binary image that highlights the foreground parts. To further reduce artefacts, median blurring is employed. Morphological techniques such as dilation are then applied to enlarge the areas of interest, which helps to detect continuous zones that correspond to parked cars.

            The analysis of these processed photos is where our occupancy detection really shines. A cropped zone is used to indicate each parking place, and it is here that the number of non-zero pixels is determined. Occupancy status is established based on a predefined threshold: areas below the threshold are identified as unoccupied, while those over it are designated as occupied. Our method overlays coloured rectangles denoting spot statuses onto the original video feed to provide real-time feedback. A panel that shows the number of open slots is also present; green indicates availability and red indicates occupancy. This combination of methods guarantees precise car recognition, enabling effective resource management for parking and improving user experience

             In addition, the system's real-time data analytics capabilities could influence future urban design guidelines. Municipal authorities can make educated judgements about infrastructure investments, such as building new parking facilities or renovating existing ones to better meet demand, by closely examining parking usage trends and patterns. The effective and sustainable distribution of resources is ensured by this data-centric strategy, which promotes a more accessible and organised urban environment.

             Also, the system's ability to analyse data in real-time may influence future urban planning regulations. Municipal authorities can make well-informed decisions about infrastructure investments, such as building new parking facilities or renovating existing ones to better meet demand, by closely examining patterns and trends in parking usage. This data-driven approach promotes a more accessible and orderly urban environment by ensuring the efficient and sustainable distribution of resources.

            likewise, alternate modes of transport might be encouraged during peak hours by implementing dynamic pricing techniques based on real-time occupancy data. The system can reduce reliance on private vehicles and ease traffic congestion by incentivizing carpooling, public transportation, or cycling by dynamically altering parking prices based on demand. This proactive approach to traffic management encourages more environmentally friendly urban mobility solutions and builds a transport network that is more sustainable overall.

            As well, the system's capacity to provide drivers with real-time information on parking spot availability and occupancy can significantly enhance their entire parking experience. When drivers are equipped with precise and timely information, they can minimise search time and irritation by making well-informed judgements about where to park. In addition to providing benefits to individual drivers, this improved user experience encourages more effective use of municipal parking resources and easier traffic flow across the city.

            To sum up, the incorporation of occupancy detection methods into our parking space monitoring system signifies a noteworthy progression in the field of urban parking management. The technology uses real-time data analysis and cutting-edge image processing techniques to provide accurate and useful insights on parking spot availability. This facilitates more efficient resource allocation and promotes sustainable urban mobility solutions. New technologies like ours are essential to the development of smarter, more livable urban environments for both locals and tourists as cities change.





                             




















                          CHAPTER 3 EXPERIMENTS



3.1 DATA COLLECTION AND PREPROCESSING

 
                        Figure. 4. Data collection and pre-processing



              We use camera footage from the authorised parking area for the preprocessing and data gathering stages of our parking space monitoring project. This video captures a range of situations, including different types of vehicles, illumination, and parking habits, simulating real-world environments for comprehensive system training. After obtaining the video data, we begin preprocessing in order to prepare it for further analysis. First, all frames are converted to grayscale—a crucial first step meant to streamline further processing and save processing power. Next, Gaussian blur is used to smooth out the picture and reduce noise, which improves the performance of later algorithms by minimising artefact interference.
Adaptive thresholding is the next phase, which is a critical method to separate the cars in the front from the background. This adaptive method ensures effective segmentation under a variety of illumination situations found in the parking area by constantly adjusting the threshold based on local pixel intensities.

             After thresholding, we use median blurring to improve the binary picture quality even further by reducing small noise and irregularities. This refining stage helps create more distinct object borders, which makes it easier to identify and divide up the cars in the parking lot.

The morphological procedures dilatation and erosion are then used to adjust the structure of the binary picture. In order to accurately delineate and separate individual cars from the backdrop, these techniques are essential for filling in gaps in identified objects and smoothing contours.Our goal is to maximise performance and dependability by carefully gathering data and preparing it in accordance with the specifications of our parking spot monitoring system. An analysis's and decision-making procedures' correctness is directly impacted by the quality of the data.


3.2 PARKING SPACE OCCUPANCY ANALYSIS


             We use a methodical technique to analyse parking space occupancy in our project by determining how many parking spaces are available in the allocated region. Based on the processed video stream, each parking space's occupancy status is examined repeatedly during this procedure.We extract appropriate areas of interest (ROIs) from the preprocessed frames by using predetermined parking spot placements that we acquired from the dataset. We do pixel-level analysis inside these ROIs to ascertain whether cars are present or absent.By using methods like contour detection and thresholding, we can differentiate between parking spots that are filled or vacant. A high density of foreground pixels designates an occupied area, indicating that cars are present there, whereas a low density of foreground pixels designates an empty parking space.

              Not only that, but we can also spot use trends and patterns by combining occupancy data over long time periods, which makes it easier to plan strategically for parking optimisation and management.

Through this systematic analysis, we generate real-time insights into parking space utilization, providing stakeholders with valuable information for decision-making and resource allocation. Additionally, by aggregating occupancy data over extended periods, we can identify usage patterns and trends, facilitating strategic planning for parking management and optimization.

              We use a methodical approach in our project to examine parking space occupancy, with an emphasis on determining how many spaces are available inside the allocated area. We continuously assess each parking space's occupancy status using the processed video feed. We perform pixel-level analysis inside the preprocessed frames to identify the presence or absence of vehicles, and then select areas of interest (ROIs) based on predetermined parking spot placements taken from the dataset. We are able to differentiate between parking spaces that are filled and those that are empty by using methods like thresholding and contour detection. Foreground pixels with a high density denote an area that is occupied by cars, whereas pixels with a low density signify an empty parking space.

              Further, our analysis goes beyond real-time data to find long-term usage trends and patterns. Combining occupancy data over longer periods of time enables us to strategically plan for parking optimisation and management. We can make well-informed decisions and allocate resources for parking management and optimisation techniques by identifying patterns and trends.
